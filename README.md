# Lost Ark Region Switcher
**With this script you can change the Lost Ark region without starting the game.**

Additionally, you can check the currently configured Lost Ark region. 

## Requirements

- Powershell 5.x or 7.x is required.
- Administrative permission to run Powershell scripts on the computer

## How to run this script

First, it will ask for the Steam installation path and this path will be saved in a file in the user's temp folder. 

Also, before changing the region, a backup copy of the UserOption.xml user file is created, which is also saved in the user's temporary folder.

After changing the Lost Ark region, you will need to manually launch the game via Steam.
